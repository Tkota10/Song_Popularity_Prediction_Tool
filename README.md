# Predicting Song Popularity

*Hey, you got Aux?*

One of the most anxiety inducing questions one can experience. You have the impossible task to pick a song that not only fits the mood, but also leaves everyone
happy and satisfied. 
Conversely, imagine you’re an upcoming musician. How should you go about picking a song that maximizes plays and increases your reach? 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the top 1% of artists earn 77% of recorded music income. 
Therefore, having a tool that enables musicians to increase the chances of their song’s success would be extremely valuable. 
In this project, we **explore** what variables or features that best correlate with danceability—a spotify created statistic related to how “danceable” a song is-as well as 
total streams. Furthermore, we **identify strategies** that help ‘aux controllers’ and rising musicians maximize their chances of satisfying their respective audience!
